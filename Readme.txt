#WAS able to get the images moving.;
turns out the <script> with src javascript had to be puton the bottn because 
it didn't validate some things created in the bottom (THE IMG)
now We have somemoving images</script>

this Project can be improve by 
including a counter of Player wins vs AI wins..
A better design
maybe background?
Declare a winner.
BUTTONS : better looking. maybe a smaller icon image?
better Title.
